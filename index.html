        'Mama' Socorro Herrera opened Yuca's, a taco stand in a liquor store parking
        lot on Hillhurst Avenue in Los Angeles' Los Feliz neighborhood. If you're
        not from LA, meaning you aren't accustomed to having some of the best meals
        of your life in restaurants akin to a shack, you might think this unassuming
        restaurant is not worth your time. But the meat at Yuca's is so perfect even
        stuffiest of diners will forget to care about the modest surroundings.
        Yuca's is not just beloved by LA natives, it won a James Beard award
        in 2005.

          Yuca's is home to excellent carnitas, carne asada and machaca, which will
          probably be familiar to you if you have ever eaten
          Mexican food, but it also serves a special Yucatan style dish called
          cochinita pibil. Chochinita pibil is slow cooked pork, similar to carnitas,
          but it is prepared with a special blend of seasonings and cooked in a
          banana leaf, which gives it a remarkable flavour. Yuca's serves traditional
          tacos, tortas, and flat burritos - meaning they contain only pinto beans,
          pico de gallo, and your choice of meat.

        Beyond traditional Mexican fare, Yuca's serves burgers. You might not
        expect a small Mexican restaurant to excel in making burgers, but the
        Yuca's family can really cook.

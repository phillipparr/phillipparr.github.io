      'Mama' Socorro Herrera opened Yuca's, a taco stand in a liquor store parking
      lot on Hillhurst Avenue in Los Angeles' Los Feliz neighborhood. If you're
      not from LA, meaning you aren't accustomed to having some of the best meals
      of your life in restaurants akin to a shack, you might think this unassuming
      restaurant is not worth your time. But the meat at Yuca's is so perfect even
      stuffiest of diners will forget to care about the modest surroundings.
      Yuca's is not just beloved by LA natives, it won a James Beard award
      in 2005.

      Yuca's is home to excellent carnitas, carne asada and machaca, which will
      probably be familiar to you if you have ever eaten
      Mexican food, but it also serves a special Yucatan style dish called
      cochinita pibil. Chochinita pibil is slow cooked pork, similar to carnitas,
      but it is prepared with a special blend of seasonings and cooked in a
      banana leaf, which gives it a remarkable flavour. Yuca's serves traditional
      tacos, tortas, and flat burritos - meaning they contain only pinto beans,
      pico de gallo, and your choice of meat.

      Beyond traditional Mexican fare, Yuca's serves burgers. You might not
      expect a small Mexican restaurant to excel in making burgers, but the
      Yuca's family can really cook.

Yuca's Tacos on Hillhurst Avenue is a Mexican eatery serving food from the Yucatan Region of Mexico. It has excellent carnitas, carne asada and machaca, which will probably be familiar to you if you have ever eaten Mexican food, but it also serves
      a special Yucatan style dish called cochinita pibil. Chochinita pibil is slow cooked pork, similar to carnitas, but it is prepared with a special blend of seasonings and cooked in a banana leaf, which gives it a remarkable flavour. Yuca's serves
      traditional tacos, flat burritos - meaning they contain only pinto beans, pico de gallo, and your choice of meat - and tortas.

  <p>Beyond traditional Mexican fare, Yuca's serves burgers. You might not expect a small Mexican restaurant to excel in making burgers, but the Yuca's family can really cook.</p>

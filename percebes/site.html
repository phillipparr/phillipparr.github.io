    <h1>Military Expenditure and Arms Imports in the Middle East</h1>
    <h2>Arms</h2>
    <p>
      For much of the post-Cold War era the U.S. was both the world’s hegemonic power, and also its preferred arms supplier. Nowhere else was this trend more visible than in the Middle East - specifically within the Gulf Arab countries - where it was effectively the monopoly supplier for much of that time.</p>

    <p>“It’s important to stress that the U.S. has always been the most important supplier [to the Middle East],” says Pieter Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers and Military Expenditure Program. “That is something that has continued since the 1970s and not much change has taken place there.”</p>

    <p>But relations in the Middle East have changed dramatically over the last decade, as countries in the region have begun to question the U.S.’ role as the guarantor of peace. These changes have created what John Calabrese, Director of the Middle East-Asia Project at American University, calls “the post-Hegemonic Middle East”.

    <h3>What motivates arms exports?</h3>
    <p>
      Many people believe that nations utilize arms exports to make immediate policy demands on receiving countries. While there is a political component to arms deals, it’s not necessarily based on strict conditionalities.</p>

    <p>“Arms are inherently political,” says Spencer Willardson, a professor specializing in the arms trade at the Nazarbayev University. “But I think less in ways than we typically think. They’re more indicative of long-term relationships and states’ abilities to connect with one another in ways that are complementary to but outside of alliances.”</p>

    <p>And though the arms trade is “inherently political”, oftentimes profit supplants politics in the decision-making behind these deals.</p>

    <p>“Most countries, even democracies, have a default yes position,” says Willardson. “If there is a country that wants to purchase arms, the default answer is going to be ‘yes you can unless’. What falls into that unless category can shift over time and shift based on the administration. But for most states the default position is: ‘we will sell arms’.”</p>

    <p>By taking a closer look at U.S., Russian, and Chinese relations and arms exports to the Middle East, we can get a better idea of the economic and political motivations underpinning their dealings there.

    <h3>U.S</h3>
    <p>
      During the Cold War, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union used arms exports to the Middle East as a way of reinforcing countries within its sphere of influence.</p>

    <p>After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when the U.S. became the world’s hegemonic power and the de-facto security guarantor of the region, the U.S. initially leapfrogged Russia in terms of arms exports to the Middle East, according to Clayton Thomas, an analyst on Middle Eastern Affairs for the Congressional Research Service. Arms exports to the region were used by the U.S. as a way of stabilizing the region, and as a way of ensuring the continued flow of oil from Saudi Arabia, upon which the U.S. was highly dependent until the recent shale boom.</p>

    <p>Foreign arms sales make up a sizeable chunk – 6.2% - of U.S. exports, compared to the world average of 0.8%. And over the last 10 years arms exports to the Middle East have made up almost 50% of these exports, most of which went to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the top two arms importers in the region, according to Thomas.</p>

    <p>However, in recent years the U.S. has rejected various deals, fearful that their technology will be appropriated by the receiving countries. Agreements with Israel can also limit arms deals with other countries in the region.</p>

    <p>“There has always been the condition that Israel would receive the highest quality equipment with the most advanced technology,” says Wezeman.</p>

    <p>But Trump has recently signaled his desire to upend the entire arms trade apparatus by more proactively seeking out arms contracts.</p>

    <p>“Trump’s instinct is to make a deal and he’s turned arms into a symbol of the U.S. and its power and being a friend with the U.S.,” says Willardson. “He has changed longstanding policy to make the bureaucratic apparatus work for defense companies in drumming up business instead of facilitating sales.”

    <p>It’s a radical shift, but one that emulates what President Putin did long ago.

    </p>
    <div class="shortline"></div>
    <h3>Russia</h3>
    <p>
      After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia saw a dip in its total arms exports to the Middle East.</p>
    <p>However, with a large arms cache in hand, a legacy of the Soviet Union’s arms industry, Russia had the capacity to use arms proactively. And when Putin came to power, he began to do just this.</p>

    <p>“Putin uses arms differently,” says Willardson. “He is very proactive in the sale of arms. It’s not just a default yes position but he is actively seeking partners and sales.”</p>

    <p>For Russia, the arms trade is motivated primarily by economic reasons. It’s another route towards creating a “sanction-proof” economy, according to a study by the Rand Corporation.</p>

    <p>“There are few opportunities to export Russian cars or computers or mobile phones,” says Wezeman. “But in the area of arms, there remains a demand for Russian arms. I suspect the economic aspects remain the most important for Russia, but of course it’s a way to exert some influence.”</p>

    <p>That influence comes in the way of frustrating Western action in the Middle East and reinforcing the image of Russia as a great power.</p>

    <p>Russia opposes outside intervention in the Middle East, instead upholding the values of sovereignty and stability of the region over anything else. Preoccupation over its own extremist Muslim population as well as the spillover effects from more revolutionary activity in the Middle East, only reinforce Russia’s preference for regional stability.</p>

    <p>Supplying arms to Iran and Syria are ways of upholding these principles and disincentivizing incursionary action from the West. And by complicating Western action, Russia appears strong both internationally and at home.</p>

    <p>Russia is now in a race to capture arms sales from the U.S., according to the Rand Corporation. The recent signing of various arms deals with Iraq and Egypt, which have in recent years been partners of the U.S., signals that it’s already moving in this direction.

    <div class="shortline"></div>
    <h3>China</h3>
    <p>
      Having risen to power relatively recently, and with a focus on supplying arms to its national military, China’s role as an arms supplier and its political motivations in the Middle East differ significantly from those of Russia and the U.S.</p>

    <p>Only recently, in 2016, has China officially formulated a foreign policy for the Middle East. As an arms supplier to the Middle East it currently ranks 15th.</p>

    <p>China’s interest in the region seems to be economically motivated. It’s focused on ensuring that the Middle Eastern oil it’s so heavily dependent on, continues to flow Eastward. As a consequence, it’s using its soft power and economic incentives, like the “One Belt One Road Initiative”, to maximize developmental cooperation and safeguard the good standing it has with most countries in the region.</p>

    <p>But China is also keen on showing itself to be a legitimate great power, and engagement with the Middle East is the ultimate litmus test for this kind of validation. Its willingness over the last few years, along with Russia, to fill the gaps left by the U.S., such as supplying arms to Syria and Iran, are ways of building alternative inroads in the region. Iran has been the biggest recipient of Chinese arms in the Middle East.</p>

    <p>The sale of drones to Saudi Arabia and the agreement to cooperate with the Saudis in building a drone industry within the country in 2017 (beyond the scope of this data) - something the U.S. was unwilling to do for intellectual property reasons - is an example of its expanding influence.</p>

    <p>“The possibility to sell these armed drones and technology to Saudi Arabia could be important, their first real step into that market,” says Wezeman. “It could be the thing they use to show that they are delivering good quality equipment for a good price and they’re willing to share technology that others might be reluctant about.”</p>

    <p>Prioritizing economic development and infrastructure projects remains central to China’s risk-averse strategy in the Middle East. However, in its first officially released “Arab Policy Paper”,  China has intimated at a more involved role as an arms supplier in the future, according to a report by the Century Foundation.

    <h2>Military Expenditure</h2>
    <p>
    Since the Middle East shed its formal western colonization, the region has become one of the hot points of world geopolitics. Doomed by its broad access to oil resources and its strategic position as a border between Europe and the East, wars and threats of new conflict have driven the military expenditure in this region up over the last decades.

    <h3></h3>
    <p>
      The military expenditure in the region amounts to 7.39% of world spending, according to data released by SIPRI in 2016, but the area hosts only 3% of the global population.
    </p>

    <p>
      This figure rose by 10% over the last decade, except in 2016, when it shrunk as a consequence of oil prices dropping in most countries in the region in the years before 2016.

    <h3>Strong Oil Dependency</h3>
    <p>
      “Most of these states strongly depend on oil exports. The more they earn from these sales, the more purchases they can afford, and that affects the military expenditure too,” says the Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers and Military Expenditure Programme, Pieter Wezeman.
    </p>

    <p>The International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE) researchers Mahmoud A. El-Gamal and Amy Myers have recently published an article backing up this theory. “A significant part of Arab countries’ military equipment (and Russia’s) used in recent conflicts was accumulated during oil boom years following the Iraqi invasion (2003-2007) and during the Arab Spring uprising (2011-2013)”, they explain.
    </p>

    <p>In the paper, they recommend that rather than increase arms, major economies such as the United States, China and Europe should encourage the acceleration of economic reforms such as those proposed by the Saudi Crown Prince. “Forty years of military build-ups have failed to bring peace and economic prosperity in the Middle East.”
    </p>

    <p>According to him, it is difficult to assess an accurate figure on how much money these countries are spending. Far from official budgets, Wezeman reckons that Middle East countries “very likely” include hidden line items that would make the expenditure bigger. Nevertheless, the data SIPRI publishes provides an idea of the minimum trend the region is experiencing.

    <h3></h3>
    <p>
      The military leader in the region is Saudi Arabia. The kingdom accounts for 50.4% of the military expenditure in the Middle East, increasing this spending 36% over the last decade.
    </p>

    <p>“There is a perception of Iran as a militarily important country, but the reality is that this country’s economy has not done very well lately and could not spend as much on its army as the Saudis have,” points out Wezeman, who highlighted the importance of the arms blockade on Iran to weaken its army.

    <h3>What caused the increase in investment on military in the Middle East? </h3>
    <p>
      In the opinion of this SIPRI expert, one of the key points has to do with the diplomatic rift and military race that have sprouted in the Middle East over the last years. Apart from the Syrian conflict, where countries like Turkey, Israel, and Saudi Arabia are directly involved, the region hosts a cruel war in Yemen, where two blocs, each funded by Iran and Saudi Arabia, fight in a proxy war that goes back to 2014.
    </p>

    <p>“There is a new reality in the Middle East, which is that, apart from Oman, every country has used their armies in some military conflict in the last three years, either in Syria, Yemen or Somalia,” Wezeman explains.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the tensions between the Saudi kingdom and Qatar increased after the latter decided to restore diplomatic relations with Iran. Backed by other countries such as the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain or Egypt, Saudi Arabia imposed a diplomatic veto on Qatar, withdrawing diplomatic officers and applying a commercial blockade.
    </p>
    <p>The conflict drove Qatar to strengthen its army and increase its expenditure. However, attaining new arms and sophisticated defence technology is not always the final goal, but the means to achieve something else.
    </p>
    <p>Over the last year, the Gulf country has signed $20bn in contracts to buy 96 new jets from three nations: F-15s from America, Typhoons from Britain, and Rafales from France. The paradox is that its army does not have enough pilots to pilot them.
    </p>
    <p>“In cases like this one, arms trading can be seen as a way of improving diplomatic relations with other powerful countries. If any government provides juicy business to important Western companies, these Western governments will treat it better,” Wezeman says.
    </p>
    <p>Another reason that, in his opinion, explains the rising expenditure in the region has to do with the interest in showing off. “They are used to being very wealthy nations. If you want a Ferrari, you will want to have the most advanced version of the M16 rifle,” he stresses.
    </p>
    <p>As to the possibility of an open war with Qatar, he considers this an “unlikely scenario”. The reason? The big number of casualties among Western citizens living in the small Gulf country that a conflict like this would cause. “However, Kuwait faced a war despite being a very tiny nation, so we should not completely dismiss it”.</p>
